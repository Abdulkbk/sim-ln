# sim-ln

A Lightning Network simulation library that enables testing and analysis of payment routing behavior in a controlled environment.

## Overview

sim-ln provides a framework for simulating Lightning Network payment routing behavior, allowing developers and researchers to:

- Create simulated Lightning Network topologies
- Test payment routing strategies
- Analyze network behavior under different conditions
- Simulate real Lightning node implementations (LND, c-lightning, Eclair)
